# 🧭 Phoenix Developer Support Request Wizard

This is a lightweight, step-by-step internal utility designed to help developers structure and streamline their support or escalation requests before reaching out to senior developers or managers.

## 🌟 Purpose

Too often, senior team members are approached with incomplete context, leading to time-consuming back-and-forth. This wizard solves that by:

- Encouraging **self-diagnosis and initial troubleshooting**
- Promoting **team collaboration** before escalation
- Structuring responses in a clear, professional format
- Automatically generating an email with all relevant details

## 🧰 Features

- Step-by-step wizard with contextual guidance
- Input fields for each diagnostic and collaborative step
- Email summary is auto-generated and pre-filled with responses
- Supports email clients like **Outlook** and **Thunderbird**
- Developer name and recipient email validations included

## 📦 How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
2. Fill in the steps with as much detail as possible.
3. Add your name in the developer's name input who is requesting support and the email address of your manager whom you are seeking help with.
4. Click **Submit** to trigger your email client with a formatted summary.

> Note: Make sure your default email client is configured for `mailto:` links.
